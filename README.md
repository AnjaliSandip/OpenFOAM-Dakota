About: This program integrates the capabilities of electromagnetic design software, Elmer FEM, and data analytics toolbox, Dakota.  It is written in bash and can be run in serial or parallel.  It uses functionality from the underlying packages.  The program was developed to integrate Dakota version 6.10 with Elmer FEM version 8.1.   It can be extended to other versions of Elmer FEM and Dakota with minor modifications.
